# SASS Utilities

This project includes access to utility functions from
[@thesoulfresh/sass-theming](/?path=/docs/design-system_utils-mixins--page)

To document local SASS utilities, simply document them using
[SassDoc Notation](http://sassdoc.com/annotations/) and run
`yarn sass-docs` to regenerate the documentation. SASS docs
are also regenerated as part of the build.
